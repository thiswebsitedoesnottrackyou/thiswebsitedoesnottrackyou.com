# This website does not track you

This website does not track you is a celebration of websites that welcome and respect a visitor's privacy.

## Join Us 

- Do you run a website that respects a vistor's privacy? 
- That **does not**  track, fingerprint, or otherwise spy on vistors?
- And **does not** load content or images hosted by social media companies (social buttons, Tweets, Instagram images, etc)?

If so, let your users know by putting this banner on your website:
